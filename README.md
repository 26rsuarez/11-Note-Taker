# 11-Note-Taker

## Description
This note taking application allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. The notes are saved on a json file. This application is deployed on heroku. The application was made possible with the use of node.js and express. The html and js files are loaded through the help of server requests.

## Challenges 
Getting the front-end to communicate with the back-end, using api-routes and html-routes. The json file is read and it's contents are used when needed. The files content is altered so making sure the object structure remained intact was a challenge. Making sure all of the files connected to the app was a hurdle.


## Usage instructions

The app is deployed in heroku at the link below.
